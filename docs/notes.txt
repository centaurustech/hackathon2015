Hello Everyone and thanks for having us!
So, What is CroFu?
Cro-Fu is the Hackathon counterpart to the Fusion Reactor CrowdFunding project
The original contributors were Bakthier Pulatov in London and Karim El Mourabet in Dubai.

This should serve as evidence in the CrowdFunding case that we,Misys should build this solution … now.

So what is Crowdfunding?
<click>
A Crowd Funding Platform is a web based market place were projects meet funders.
<click>
This is an alternative to traditional lending, because funds come from individuals.
<click>
As we speak, there are over 1300 platforms that process 34 billion dollars per year.
<click>
The target market size for 2020 is $1tn
<click>
That is one million, million dollars.

Mysis is the perfect provider for this solution

We would like to showcase 3 aspects of the solution in the context of this Hackathon
<click> The system needs to integrate to existing bank websites as well as data consumers, such as FBI.
<click> It needs to be able to cope with large volumes.
<click> It needs to be smart enough to maximize platform revenue by optimizing projects recommendations

--- Demo

What we see here is an existing HSBC website that leverages FusionFabric services to enable CrowdFunding offering.
As a user I can log into my bank website and browse existing projects
<drill crowd funding> In this list, I can pick whatever project is relevant to me, 
<drill in project> See what the current state is, and either contribute or Follow this project for later 
Let s make a donation 
<click donate> From here

<type in amount> Enter the amount I wish to donate
<click donate and close thank you> I can then go back to this project
<reopen project status> And see that progress has been recorded.

<tab 2> 
In this tab, I have a Citibank website powered by the same service.
<click Crowdfunding> 
Projects recommendation are catered to individual user profile using Apache Mahout technology. 
Please ask us questions about this.

Besides user facing services, the platform is also able to produce metrics
<tab 3, Show JSON> that could be consumed by processors such as Fusion Business Insight.

In order to cope with volumes, we had to implement a multi node FusionFabric architecture
<click>Processing request from 1k users went smooth
<click> Ramping up to 10k users showed we were losing about 10% of inbound traffic
<click> By adding a second node to our cluster, we immediately remediated the loss
