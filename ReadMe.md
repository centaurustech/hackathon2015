## Welcome

This is the squeleton CrowdFunding app that runs in cargo with a minimal rest service (ping)
- app : A minimal app that uses feature. It is configured to allow access to web:/.*
- feature : An empty feature
- rest : A minimal rest service that responds "pong" when you browse /api/ping

For clarity, this provides no features besides packages and artifacts name.
